## R1 Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.
The problem that this app is addressing is the issue of limited access to quality education relating to personal development. Limited accessibility to quality educational resources significantly impedes individuals from unlocking their full potential, acquiring new skills, or fostering personal growth.

## R2 Why is it a problem that needs solving?
Unfortunately, many individuals worldwide lack access to quality personal development courses due to financial and social limitations. While several online learning platforms exist, many quality ones often come with a price tag, limiting accessibility for those with financial constraints. Furthermore, even among the available free resources, there might be limitations in the scope and depth of content, catering only to specific niches or lacking comprehensive coverage across various personal development domains. By developing an API that provides a diverse array of free personal development courses, it can empower individuals and contribute to a more informed and skilled global population. 

By creating this API it will allow seamless access to educational content, enabling individuals from various locations, especially those in underserved or remote areas, to connect to the platform and access high-quality learning materials. An API-driven approach enables continuous improvements and additions to the platform. It allows for scalability, ensuring that as the platform grows, it can accommodate more users and offer new courses or features.
